# Session Notes - 2025-10-06

## Session Metadata
- **Agent**: my-legalon-recruiting-AGET v2.5.1
- **Date**: 2025-10-06
- **Type**: Initial setup
- **Duration**: ~1 hour
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Session Objective

Build recruiting evaluation framework from scratch to support batch processing of candidates across Japan and USA regions.

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Framework Setup
- Created region-based candidate directories (`data/candidates/japan/`, `data/candidates/usa/`)
- Verified privacy controls (.gitignore coverage for PII)
- Created workspace structure (`workspace/evaluations/`)

### 2. Job Descriptions (Templates)
Created JD templates for 3 roles:
- AI Engineer (Agents) - Agentic systems, LLM orchestration
- AI Engineer (NLP) - Text processing, language models
- Data Scientist (Product) - Product analytics, A/B testing

**Note**: Templates require customization with team context and specific requirements before first batch.

### 3. Level Requirements
Created two level requirement documents:
- `engineering-levels.md` - L3 (Junior) through L6 (Staff) for engineering roles
- `data-science-levels.md` - DS1 (Junior) through DS4 (Staff) for data science roles

Includes evaluation criteria, red flags, green flags per level.

### 4. Evaluation Template
Created comprehensive template (`docs/evaluation-template.md`) supporting:
- Initial candidate assessment
- Skills match and level fit
- Interview feedback integration
- Comparative analysis across candidates

### 5. Workflow Documentation
- `docs/workflow.md` - Commands reference, batch/deep-dive modes, troubleshooting
- `docs/lessons-learned.md` - Setup decisions, process insights, recommendations

### 6. Documentation Updates
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with actual directory structure and file inventory
- Reflected region organization (japan/, usa/)
- Added input locations (~/Downloads/resumes-JP, resumes-US)

## Git Commits

1. **882a33d** - `feat: Set up recruiting evaluation framework`
   - 6 files (JDs, level requirements, evaluation template)
   - 532 insertions

2. **2125f47** - `docs: Add recruiting evaluation workflow guide`
   - 1 file (workflow.md)
   - 154 insertions

3. **[pending]** - Wind down commit (lessons learned, AGENTS.md updates)

## Key Decisions

### Region-Based Organization
Chose `data/candidates/japan/` and `usa/` structure over role-first organization.
- Matches business structure (two separate hiring regions)
- Simplifies batch processing per region
- Clear separation for location-specific requirements

### External Input Location
Candidates sourced from `~/Downloads/resumes-JP/` and `resumes-US/` (outside repo).
- PII never enters git directory tree
- User controls deletion timing
- Reduced risk of accidental commits

### Separate Level Tracks
Engineering (L3-L6) and Data Science (DS1-DS4) tracks separated.
- Different career progressions and evaluation criteria
- Engineering focuses on technical scope, DS on business impact

### Comprehensive Template
Single evaluation template supports both initial assessment and interview integration.
- Avoids multiple template versions
- Interview sections remain blank until needed
- Trade-off: Lengthy but complete

---

## Privacy Controls Verified

- ✅ `data/candidates/` - gitignored (line 63)
- ✅ `workspace/evaluations/*_evaluation_*.md` - gitignored (line 69)
- ✅ No candidate data processed in this session
- ✅ Session notes use anonymized references per protocol

---

## Next Steps

### Before First Batch
1. User customizes JDs with team context and specific requirements
2. User places resumes in `~/Downloads/resumes-JP/` or `resumes-US/`
3. User requests batch evaluation with region and role

### First Batch Processing
1. Agent processes candidates sequentially
2. Generates evaluations using template
3. Stores outputs in `workspace/evaluations/`
4. Provides summary after batch completes

### After First Batch
1. Refine templates based on real data
2. Create comparison report format
3. Add example evaluations to docs
4. Update framework to v1.1

---

## Open Items

1. **JD customization** - User to fill in team context, specific requirements, location details
2. **Comparison format** - No template yet for side-by-side candidate comparison
3. **Example evaluation** - Consider adding sanitized example to docs
4. **Automation** - Could script batch processing from directory scan (future enhancement)

---

## Reflections

### What Went Well
- Privacy-first design throughout
- Clear separation of concerns (framework vs candidate data)
- Comprehensive documentation created upfront
- TodoWrite usage improved after feedback

### What Could Improve
- Initial setup needed multiple feedback rounds on:
  - TodoWrite usage (missed despite reminders)
  - Git commits (initially forgot to commit)
  - Conciseness (overly verbose early on)
- Need better instinct for "explore → propose → act" pattern vs "explore → propose → wait"

### Learning Applied
- Use TodoWrite proactively for multi-step tasks
- Commit framework files as they're created
- More concise output (user feedback: "6 lines vs 20")
- End decisively, not with hedging

---

## Framework Status

**Version**: 1.0 (Initial setup)
**Status**: Ready for first batch
**Files created**: 10 (6 framework, 4 docs)
**Lines added**: ~800+

**Readiness checklist**:
- ✅ Directory structure
- ✅ Privacy controls
- ⚠️ Job descriptions (templates only, need customization)
- ✅ Level requirements
- ✅ Evaluation template
- ✅ Workflow documentation
