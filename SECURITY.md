## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within CLI Agent Template, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email the details to the repository maintainer through GitHub
3. Include the following information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Security Best Practices

When using CLI Agent Template:

1. **Never commit sensitive data**
   - API keys, tokens, passwords should never be in your repository
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Add sensitive files to `.gitignore`

2. **Review generated code**
   - Always review code generated by AI agents before committing
   - Check for hardcoded credentials or sensitive information
   - Validate that generated code follows security best practices

3. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regularly update Python dependencies with `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
   - Monitor for security advisories in dependencies

4. **Audit agent access**
   - Be aware of what files and commands your AI agents can access
   - Use the dry-run options when available
   - Review the session logs to understand what actions were taken
