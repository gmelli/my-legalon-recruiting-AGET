## What [PROJECT]-aget IS
- ✅ **Strategic Decision Maker** - Decides architectural direction
- ✅ **Philosophy Holder** - Maintains project's core principles
- ✅ **Quality Gatekeeper** - Defines "good enough" for the project
- ✅ **Experimentation Lab** - Tests risky changes safely
- ✅ **Pattern Library** - Stores project-specific patterns
- ✅ **Context Keeper** - Remembers why decisions were made
- ✅ **Evolution Tracker** - Documents project's growth

## What [PROJECT]-aget DOES

### Strategic Functions
- **Architectural Decisions** - "Should we use microservices?"
- **Technology Choices** - "PostgreSQL vs MongoDB?"
- **Pattern Selection** - "Which design patterns fit our needs?"
- **Quality Standards** - "What's our test coverage target?"
- **Breaking Changes** - "When is it worth breaking compatibility?"

### Experimental Functions
- **Prototype Features** - Try new capabilities safely
- **Test Refactorings** - Validate architectural changes
- **Explore Libraries** - Evaluate new dependencies
- **Performance Tests** - Benchmark different approaches

### Memory Functions
- **Decision History** - Why we chose X over Y
- **Failed Experiments** - What didn't work and why
- **Success Patterns** - What worked well
- **Context Preservation** - Business/technical context

```

## Practical Workflow

### For New Features
1. **Question arises** in main project
2. **Experiment in [PROJECT]-aget** with multiple approaches
3. **Validate** the best approach
4. **Document decision** in evolution log
5. **Implement in [PROJECT]** with confidence

### For Architecture Changes
1. **Identify need** for structural change
2. **Prototype in [PROJECT]-aget** safely
3. **Test migration path**
4. **Plan rollout** with fallback options
5. **Execute in [PROJECT]** with preparation

### For Technical Debt
1. **Track debt** in [PROJECT]-aget
2. **Prioritize** based on impact
3. **Design solutions** experimentally
4. **Schedule** into main project work
5. **Verify** debt reduction

## Success Metrics

- Decisions made before implementation
- Experiments that prevented bad choices
- Context preserved across time
- Patterns extracted and reused
- Technical debt tracked and addressed

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ **Over-architecting** - Don't design for problems you don't have
- ❌ **Analysis paralysis** - Experiments should be time-boxed
- ❌ **Ivory tower** - Stay connected to real project needs
- ❌ **Perfect memory** - It's okay to forget failed experiments
- ❌ **Solo decisions** - Include team/stakeholders when appropriate
