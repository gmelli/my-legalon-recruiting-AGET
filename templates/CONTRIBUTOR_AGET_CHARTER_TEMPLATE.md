# Charter for [PROJECT]-aget (Contributor's Private Workshop)

## Identity
**[PROJECT]-aget** is your private workspace for understanding, experimenting with, and preparing contributions to [PROJECT], which is managed by others.

## The Contributor's Dilemma
When contributing to a team project, you need space to:
- Understand code without asking "dumb" questions
- Try multiple approaches before proposing one
- Break things privately before submitting publicly
- Build context about unwritten team conventions
- Maintain your own notes and understanding

## What Contributor's [PROJECT]-aget IS
- ✅ **Private Sandbox** - Safe place to experiment without judgment
- ✅ **Learning Lab** - Figure out how things actually work
- ✅ **Draft Workshop** - Prepare contributions before going public
- ✅ **Context Accumulator** - Build understanding over time
- ✅ **Pattern Detector** - Identify team's implicit conventions
- ✅ **Confidence Builder** - Validate ideas before proposing

## What Contributor's [PROJECT]-aget DOES

### Understanding Phase
```
Team's Code → My X-aget → "Oh, THAT's why they do it that way"
```
- **Code Archaeology** - Trace through confusing parts
- **Reverse Engineering** - Understand undocumented behavior
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identify consistent practices
- **Dependency Mapping** - Understand what connects to what

### Experimentation Phase
```
My Ideas → X-aget Experiments → "This won't work because..."
```
- **Multiple Approaches** - Try different solutions privately
- **Break Things** - Understand failure modes
- **Performance Tests** - Validate efficiency claims
- **Edge Cases** - Explore what could go wrong

### Preparation Phase
```
Rough Solution → X-aget Polish → Clean PR
```
- **Code Cleanup** - Match team's style perfectly
- **Test Coverage** - Exceed their standards
- **Documentation** - Anticipate reviewer questions
- **Commit Messages** - Follow their conventions

## Workflows for Contributors

### First Contribution
1. **Clone their repo** to main workspace
2. **Create X-aget** as your private laboratory
3. **Explore safely** in X-aget
4. **Understand patterns** through experimentation
5. **Prepare contribution** with confidence
6. **Submit PR** from main workspace

### Ongoing Contributions
1. **Sync latest changes** from upstream
2. **Experiment in X-aget** with new ideas
3. **Test thoroughly** in private
4. **Polish to their standards**
5. **Submit clean PR**
6. **Document learnings** for next time

## The Psychology of Contributor's X-aget

### Private Learning
- No embarrassment from "obvious" questions
- Freedom to misunderstand initially
- Space to build mental model gradually

### Confidence Building
- Validate ideas before public exposure
- Test edge cases without criticism
- Build expertise privately

### Professional Appearance
- Submit polished work only
- Demonstrate understanding through quality
- Build reputation methodically

## Success Patterns

### Good Contributor X-aget Usage
- ✅ "Let me understand their auth system first" → Experiment in X-aget
- ✅ "I'll try three approaches" → Test all in X-aget, submit best
- ✅ "This seems fragile" → Break it in X-aget to understand limits
- ✅ "Their style is different" → Practice in X-aget until natural

### Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Copying their private code into X-aget
- ❌ Testing in production/main repo
- ❌ Submitting first attempt without experimentation
- ❌ Ignoring team conventions discovered in X-aget

## Evolution from Contributor to Maintainer

```
External Contributor → Regular Contributor → Trusted Contributor → Maintainer
        ↓                      ↓                    ↓                  ↓
  Heavy X-aget use      Still use X-aget     Less X-aget       Might not need
   (learning phase)      (complex stuff)     (know codebase)     (you ARE team)
```

## The Beautiful Reality

**Your X-aget is YOUR space** where you can:
- Be confused without judgment
- Try "stupid" ideas that might be genius
- Build understanding at your pace
- Prepare professional contributions
- Maintain your own perspective

While respecting:
- The team's ownership of the main project
- Their conventions and standards
- The collaborative process
