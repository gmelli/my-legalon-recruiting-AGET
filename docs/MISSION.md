# AGET Mission

**Help CLI-using creators to build better software enjoyably faster (using CLI coding agents)**

## The Context

CLI coding agents are powerful but unopinionated. They'll code any way you ask - which is both their strength and weakness.

## What AGET Provides: Opinionated Best Practices

AGET brings engineering discipline to CLI agent development through proven practices:

### Planning Before Coding
- **NOGOPLAN**: Incremental GO/NO-GO gated plans where every gate has clear intention
- **5-Whys Analysis**: Root cause analysis before fixing symptoms
- **Decision Documentation**: Record why, not just what

### Incremental Development
- **Gate-Based Progress**: Complete one gate before starting the next
- **Abort Points**: Know when to stop and pivot
- **Intention-First**: Every action tied to a clear purpose
- **Batch Validation**: Test assumptions before deep implementation

### Session Discipline
- **Wake/Work/Wind Down**: Structured work sessions with context preservation
- **Checkpoint Creation**: Save state at meaningful milestones
- **Evolution Tracking**: Decisions and discoveries recorded as they happen
- **Clean Handoffs**: Next session starts where last one ended

### Quality Gates
- **Pre-Release Checks**: 10-point validation before any release
- **Hygiene Scoring**: Quantified cleanliness metrics
- **Link Validation**: No broken documentation
- **Ethos Alignment**: Technical voice, not marketing speak

### Engineering Patterns
- **File Ownership**: Clear boundaries (aget_ prefix for framework)
- **Migration Paths**: Never break existing users
- **Rollback Ready**: Every change reversible
- **Test-First Mindset**: Validation before implementation

## Why These Opinions Matter

Without disciplined practices, CLI agents can produce:
```
- Quick fixes that create technical debt
- Undocumented decisions lost to history
- Big-bang changes that fail spectacularly
- Context lost between sessions
- Inconsistent quality
```

With AGET's opinionated approach:
```
✓ Incremental progress with clear abort points
✓ Documented reasoning for future reference
✓ Gate-based development that catches issues early
✓ Preserved context across sessions
✓ Consistent, measurable quality
```

## The AGET Way

1. **Plan with NOGOPLAN** - Don't dive in, map the gates
2. **Analyze with 5-Whys** - Find root causes, not symptoms
3. **Progress Incrementally** - One gate at a time
4. **Validate Early** - GO/NO-GO decisions at each gate
5. **Document Decisions** - Evolution tracking for future you
6. **Maintain Hygiene** - Clean as you go, not later
7. **Test Assumptions** - Verify before building on them

## Where AGET Works Today

- Individual developers wanting consistent patterns
- Code that evolves over months/years
- One-off scripts that grow into tools
- Switching between different AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, Aider)
- Projects where context preservation matters

## Where AGET Is Exploring

AGET represents early thinking about how CLI agents could work. In 2 years, some framework/standard will emerge for AI-assisted development. AGET aims to:

- Test patterns that might influence future standards
- Explore what "opinionated AI development" looks like
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Build evidence for best practices

This is experimental. We're learning what helps and what doesn't.
