# 5 Whys Analysis: Test Failure Root Cause

## Issue
CI tests failed because `test_gate2_features.py` expected "outputs" directory but code creates "workspace" directory.

## Timeline
- **Sep 24, 10:37** - Commit `17a4824`: Created test_gate2_features.py with "outputs" directory
- **Sep 24, 13:58** - Commit `5a1d40e`: Renamed outputs→workspace to fix case-sensitivity issues
- **Sep 24-25** - Tests continued failing until fixed in commit `bae166f`

## 5 Whys Analysis

### Why #1: Why did the tests fail?
**Answer:** The test expected "outputs" directory but the code creates "workspace" directory.

### Why #2: Why was there a mismatch between test expectations and code behavior?
**Answer:** The directory was renamed from "outputs" to "workspace" in commit `5a1d40e` (3.5 hours after the test was created) but the test wasn't updated.

### Why #3: Why wasn't the test updated when the directory was renamed?
**Answer:** The developer didn't run the full test suite after making the change, or ignored the test failure thinking it would be fixed later.

### Why #4: Why didn't the developer run tests after making a significant change?
**Answer:** No pre-commit hooks or CI checks were enforcing test passage before push. The CI only runs after push, allowing broken tests to enter main branch.

### Why #5: Why are there no pre-commit hooks enforcing test passage?
**Answer:** The project prioritizes development speed and relies on post-commit CI to catch issues, accepting temporary breakage as a tradeoff for faster iteration during early development.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Immediate Cause**: Test-code desynchronization during refactoring
2. **Contributing Cause**: No automated test execution before commit
3. **Systemic Cause**: Development workflow allows pushing without local test validation
4. **Cultural Cause**: "Move fast and fix later" approach during active development

## Additional Contributing Factors

- **Case-sensitivity issue**: The rename from "outputs/Outputs" to "workspace/products" was done to avoid macOS/Windows case-insensitivity problems
- **Rapid iteration**: 8 commits in 4 hours during Gate implementation
- **Test isolation**: Tests were likely run in isolation (per feature) rather than full suite

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Fixed tests in commit `bae166f` (already completed)
2. Add pre-push hook to run critical tests

### Short-term Improvements
1. Create a `make test-quick` command for essential tests (<5 seconds)
2. Add test verification to the "wind down" protocol
3. Document which tests must pass before push

### Long-term Solutions
1. Implement staged testing:
   - Pre-commit: Syntax and linting only (fast)
   - Pre-push: Critical tests only (<30 seconds)
   - CI: Full test suite with all Python versions
2. Add automated test-update detection when renaming directories
3. Consider test-driven refactoring for structural changes

### Process Improvements
1. When renaming directories/files:
   - Search codebase for all references
   - Update tests immediately
   - Run full test suite locally
2. Add refactoring checklist to AGENTS.md
3. Create migration patterns for safe refactoring

## Lessons Learned

1. **Speed vs. Stability Tradeoff**: Moving fast can work but needs safety nets
2. **Test-Code Coupling**: Tests are documentation - they must stay synchronized
3. **Automation Gaps**: Manual processes fail under pressure
4. **Communication**: Commit messages should mention test updates when refactoring

## Prevention Strategy

```bash
# Add to .git/hooks/pre-push
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running critical tests before push..."
python3 -m pytest tests/test_gate2_features.py tests/test_session_protocol.py -q
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Critical tests failed. Push aborted."
    echo "Run 'pytest tests/' to see failures"
    exit 1
fi
echo "✅ Critical tests passed"
```
