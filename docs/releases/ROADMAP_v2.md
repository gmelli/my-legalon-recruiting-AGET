# AGET v2.0 Roadmap - Unified Vision

*Last Updated: 2025-09-24*
*Status: Active Development (Alpha Released)*
*Original Charter: 2025-09-22 (120 hours committed)*
*Framework Evolution: 2025-09-24*

## Mission Statement

**"Help CLI-using creators to build better software enjoyably faster (using CLI coding agents)"**

- Primary mission: Help CLI-using creators build better software
- Enjoyably faster: Through conversational AI interaction
- Amplified mission: With AI collaborator when awakened
- See [docs/MISSION.md](docs/MISSION.md) for full mission details

## Vision Statement

AGET v2 delivers both a **practical CLI tool** for configuring AI agents AND a **conceptual framework** for agents that bridge private innovation to public value.

## v2.0 Implementation Goals

### Goal 1: CLI Tool (Original Charter - In Progress)
**Make any codebase AI-agent ready in <60 seconds**
- Core Promise: Working config instantly
- Status: Alpha released with `aget init`, `aget rollback`
- Remaining: Pattern library, migration tools

### Goal 2: Framework (Evolved Vision - New)
**Enable agents to evolve from exploration to value creation**
- Core Promise: Private exploration â†’ Value manifestation (public or private)
- Status: Conceptualized, ready to implement
- Key Innovation: Agents that create and maintain their own products

## Core Breakthroughs

### 1. The CLI Foundation âœ… (Original v2)
- `aget init` - Initialize agent in <60 seconds
- `aget rollback` - Safe rollback mechanism
- `aget apply` - Apply patterns (Phase 2)
- Three-tier degradation (gh/git/filesystem)

### 2. The Naming Revolution ðŸŽ¯ (New)
- `aget-*` = Framework components
- `*-aget` = Autonomous agents
- No suffix = Traditional tools

### 3. The Vocabulary Breakthrough ðŸŽ¯ (New)
- `outputs/` = Agent's internal workspace
- `Outputs` = Public products the agent creates/maintains
- `.aget/` = Framework metadata and state

### 4. The Privateâ†’Public Bridge ðŸŽ¯ (New)
- Private exploration in personal agents
- Pattern extraction through bridge tools
- Public manifestation as community value

## Implementation Phases - Unified Plan

### Phase 1: Complete CLI Core (Week 1-2) âœ…
**Goal**: Finish original v2 charter commitments
**Hours**: ~42.5 used (Gate 1: 19h, Gate 2: 13.5h, Pattern Polish: 10h)

- [x] Gate 1: Core CLI foundation (alpha released) âœ…
- [x] Gate 2: Pattern library (8 patterns functional, apply/list working) âœ…
- [x] Pattern Polish: 91 tests, aget validate, best practices âœ…
- [ ] Gate 3: Migration tools (next priority - REFINED PLAN BELOW)
- [x] Success criteria: <60 second setup achieved âœ…

### Phase 2: Framework Documentation (Week 1-2) âœ…
**Goal**: Codify the evolved vision
**Hours**: ~5 used

- [x] AGET_FRAMEWORK_VISION.md
- [x] AGET_VOCABULARY.md (outputs vs Outputs)
- [x] BRIDGE_EXTRACTION_PROCESS.md
- [x] AGET_APPLY_COMMAND.md
- [ ] DIRECTORY_STANDARDS.md (tiered templates)
- [ ] ORIGIN_STORY.md (the 90-minute sprint)

### Phase 3: First Agent with CLI (Week 2) âœ…
**Goal**: Use CLI to create first framework agent
**Hours**: ~15 (Actually: 2 hours)

- [x] Use `aget init` to create llm-manager-aget âœ…
- [x] Apply standard template pattern âœ…
- [x] Implement OpenAI spend tracking âœ…
- [x] Establish .aget/evolution/ pattern âœ…
- [x] Test CLI + Framework integration âœ…

**Lessons Learned**:
- Directory scaffolding needed (src/, outputs/, Outputs/)
- Bridge mechanism works but needs automation
- Evolution tracking invaluable but needs templates

### Gate 3: Migration Tools - COMPLETED âœ… (Week 3)
**Goal**: Help users migrate to v2 with learnings from llm-manager-aget
**Hours**: ~1 hour (vs 18 estimated - 94% time reduction!)
**Completion Date**: 2025-09-24

- [x] Add README.md in each directory explaining purpose
- [x] 13 tests passing

#### Bridge Formalization - COMPLETED âœ…

### Phase 7: Ecosystem Launch (Week 6)
**Goal**: Activate the full vision
**Hours**: ~15

- [ ] Rename repos to convention
- [ ] Create Output Registry
- [ ] Open source example agents
- [ ] Announcement: CLI + Framework

## Integration Points

### CLI Supports Framework
- `aget init` creates agent repositories with framework structure
- `aget apply` adds patterns for outputsâ†’Outputs bridging
- `aget extract` (new) pulls public value from agent outputs
- `aget validate` checks both config AND framework compliance

### Framework Uses CLI
- Agents created with `aget init --template standard`
- Pattern library includes bridge patterns
- Evolution capture integrated with rollback
- Directory standards enforced by CLI

## Breaking Changes from v1

### From Charter Commitment
- **v1 scripts**: Continue to work alongside v2
- **Backward compatible**: AGENTS.md format preserved
- **Progressive enhancement**: No forced migration

### From Framework Evolution
- **Naming**: New aget-*/\*-aget convention (optional but recommended)
- **Directory**: Tiered templates (minimal/standard/advanced)
- **Vocabulary**: outputs vs Outputs distinction
- **Concept**: Agents as value creators, not just automation

## Success Metrics

### Charter Commitments (Must Meet)
- [x] Time to working config: <60 seconds âœ…
- [x] All commands complete in <2 seconds âœ… (0.019s achieved)
- [x] Zero dependencies beyond Python 3.8+ âœ…
- [x] Backward compatible with v1 âœ…
- [ ] First 5 users successfully onboard (0/5 - test migrations don't count)

### Framework Goals (Aspirational)
- [x] 1+ agents using framework patterns (llm-manager-aget) âœ…
- [x] 1+ public Output extracted from agent (llm-cost-analyzer) âœ…
- [x] Bridge mechanism documented and proven âœ…
- [x] Evolution capture working âœ…
- [ ] 3+ agents total
- [ ] Agentâ†’Output registry established

## Hours Tracking

**Charter Commitment**: 120 hours total
- Spent: ~45.5 hours (Gate 1: 19h, Gate 2: 13.5h, Polish: 10h, Agent: 2h, Gate 3: 1h)
- Remaining: ~74.5 hours

**Framework Addition**: ~40 hours estimated
- Documentation: 10 hours
- Bridge mechanism: 20 hours
- Integration: 10 hours

**Total v2 Scope**: ~160 hours

## Migration from v1

For existing users of v1:
1. Naming updates are optional but recommended
2. Directory structure can evolve gradually
3. Core functionality remains backward compatible
4. See UPGRADING.md for detailed migration steps

## Key Deliverables

### Documentation
- [x] AGET_FRAMEWORK_VISION.md
- [ ] AGET_VOCABULARY.md
- [ ] DIRECTORY_STANDARDS.md
- [ ] ORIGIN_STORY.md

### Tools
- [ ] Template installer (`aget init`)
- [ ] Bridge extraction tool
- [ ] Evolution capture system
- [ ] Output Registry

### Example Agents
- [x] llm-manager-aget (cost tracking) âœ…
- [ ] datgen-aget (guardian/enhancer)
- [ ] spotify-aget (renamed from agent-music)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Complexity**: Start with minimal template, evolve as needed
- **Adoption**: Maintain v1 compatibility during transition
- **Scope creep**: Focus on core bridge mechanism first
- **Time**: Each phase has independent value

## Next Immediate Actions

### This Week (Phase 1-2)
1. Complete CLI Gate 2 (pattern library) - Charter commitment
2. Document AGET_VOCABULARY.md - Critical for clarity
3. Test `aget init` creates proper agent structure
4. Begin llm-manager-aget as proof of concept

### Next Week (Phase 3-4)
1. Use CLI to create llm-manager-aget properly
2. Implement OpenAI tracking
3. Build bridge extraction tool
4. Extract first public Output

## Risk Management

### Charter Risks
- **Pattern library complexity**: Start with 5 essential patterns
- **Testing overhead**: Focus on Mac/Linux first
- **User onboarding**: Create video walkthrough

### Framework Risks
- **Scope creep**: Bridge mechanism is MVP only
- **Complexity**: Keep minimal template truly minimal
- **Adoption**: Focus on personal use first

*This roadmap unifies the original v2 Charter (CLI tool) with the evolved Framework vision. Both missions reinforce each other: the CLI enables the framework, the framework validates the CLI.*
