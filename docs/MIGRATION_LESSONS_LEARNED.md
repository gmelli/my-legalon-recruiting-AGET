# Migration Lessons Learned

**Document Created**: 2025-09-28
**Context**: v2.0→v2.1 migration of 9 production agents
**Status**: Battle-tested and production-ready

## Executive Summary

Successfully migrated 9 production agents from v2.0 to v2.1 with 100% success rate. This document captures lessons learned, edge cases encountered, and recommendations for future migrations.

## Migration Statistics

- **Agents Migrated**: 9 (6 main + 3 RKB)
- **Patterns Renamed**: 45+ total
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Total Time**: ~3 minutes
- **Rollbacks Required**: 0
- **Edge Cases Found**: 5

## Issues Encountered & Solutions

### 1. Version String Variations
- **Issue**: Script rejected `2.0.0-alpha`, only accepted exact `2.0.0`
- **Solution**: Changed validation to `startswith("2.0.0")`
- **Impact**: Enabled migration of alpha/beta versions
- **Future**: Use semantic version parsing library

### 2. Missing Directories
- **Issue**: Several agents lacked `scripts/` directory
- **Solution**: Added `mkdir -p scripts` before copying migration script
- **Impact**: Seamless migration without manual intervention
- **Future**: Migration script should auto-create required directories

### 3. Symlink Complications
- **Issue**: `my-RKB-infra-aget` had `scripts -> ../../scripts` symlink
- **Solution**: Removed symlink, created real directory
- **Impact**: Required manual intervention
- **Future**: Detect and handle symlinks automatically

### 4. Field Name Inconsistencies
- **Issue**: `my-RKB-CONTENT_ENHANCER` used `"version"` instead of `"aget_version"`
- **Solution**: Manual fix before migration
- **Impact**: One-time fix required
- **Future**: Pre-migration validator should check field names

### 5. Already-Migrated Patterns
- **Issue**: `my-AGET-aget` already had `aget_` prefixes from manual work
- **Solution**: Script handled gracefully (0 patterns renamed)
- **Impact**: No negative impact - idempotency worked
- **Future**: Keep this behavior - it's a feature, not a bug

## What Worked Well

### Strengths of Current Approach
1. **Backup-First Philosophy**: Every migration created `.aget.backup-v20/`
2. **Detailed Reporting**: Clear summary of changes made
3. **Audit Trail**: Migration records with timestamps
4. **Automatic Updates**: CLAUDE.md references updated automatically
5. **Feature Preservation**: All custom agent features maintained

### Design Decisions Validated
- Pattern renaming with `aget_` prefix provides clear ownership
- Version tracking in JSON enables migration automation
- Backup strategy allows confident experimentation

## Recommendations for Future Migrations

### 1. Migration Scripts as Release Artifacts
**Recommendation**: Include battle-tested migration scripts in every release
```
scripts/migrations/
├── v1.0_to_v2.0.py
├── v2.0_to_v2.1.py
└── v2.1_to_v2.2.py  # Future
```

### 2. Pre-Migration Validation Tool
Create `aget_pre_migration_check.py`:
```python
# Check for:
- Version field consistency
- Directory structure
- Symlink detection
- Already-migrated patterns
- Custom modifications
```

### 3. Batch Migration Capability
Implement parallel migration for multiple agents:
```bash
python3 aget_batch_migrate.py --pattern "my-*-aget" --to-version 2.2
```

### 4. Migration Test Suite
Before each release:
```bash
# Test on dummy agents
python3 test_migration.py --from 2.1 --to 2.2

# Verify rollback works
python3 test_rollback.py --version 2.1
```

### 5. Version Compatibility Matrix
Document supported migration paths:
```
Source Version    Target Version    Status
2.0.0          → 2.1.0            ✓ Supported
2.0.0-alpha    → 2.1.0            ✓ Supported
2.0.0-beta     → 2.1.0            ✓ Supported
1.0.0          → 2.1.0            ✗ Must go through 2.0 first
```

## Implementation Improvements

### Enhanced Migration Script Structure
```python
class MigrationFramework:
    """Base class for all migrations"""

    def pre_flight_checks(self):
        """Validate environment before migration"""
        - Check version compatibility
        - Verify directory structure
        - Detect edge cases

    def create_backup(self):
        """Backup with verification"""
        - Create timestamped backup
        - Verify backup completeness
        - Store rollback instructions

    def migrate(self):
        """Core migration logic"""
        - Apply changes incrementally
        - Verify each step
        - Log all actions

    def post_migration_validation(self):
        """Ensure migration success"""
        - Run smoke tests
        - Verify critical features
        - Check for data loss

    def rollback(self):
        """Emergency rollback procedure"""
        - Restore from backup
        - Verify restoration
        - Log rollback reason
```

### Migration Pipeline for Releases
1. **Development Phase**: Create migration script
2. **Testing Phase**: Test on dummy agents
3. **Battle-Testing**: Run on real agents (like we did today)
4. **Refinement**: Fix edge cases found
5. **Release**: Include refined script in release

## Specific Improvements for v2.1→v2.2

Based on v2.0→v2.1 experience:

1. **Auto-detect and fix common issues**:
   - Field name variations
   - Missing directories
   - Symlinks

2. **Enhanced reporting**:
   - Progress bar for large migrations
   - Detailed change log
   - Rollback instructions

3. **Safety features**:
   - Dry-run mode by default
   - Interactive confirmation for destructive changes
   - Automatic rollback on failure

## Success Metrics

Despite encountering 5 distinct edge cases:
- **Zero failures**: All agents migrated successfully
- **Zero data loss**: All features and data preserved
- **Fast execution**: Average 20 seconds per agent
- **High confidence**: Backup + rollback capability maintained

## Conclusion

The v2.0→v2.1 migration was highly successful. The edge cases encountered made the migration script more robust and production-ready. Key insight: **real-world testing on production agents is invaluable** for discovering edge cases that wouldn't appear in controlled testing.

### Action Items
- [x] Include migration script in v2.1 release
- [x] Document lessons learned (this document)
- [ ] Create ADR for migration strategy
- [ ] Implement pre-migration validator for v2.2
- [ ] Create migration test suite

*This document should be updated after each major migration to capture new lessons learned.*
