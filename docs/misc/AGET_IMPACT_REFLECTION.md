# AGET Impact Reflection - The Builder's Dilemma

*Late night thought captured: September 25, 2025, 02:48*

## The Question
"How much impact do I want for AGET? Do I prepare a promotion plan? Friends and colleagues? The tension between building quietly..."

## The Tension
Every builder faces this: perfect in private vs iterate in public.

## Recommended Path: Soft Launch

### Phase 1: Friends (Oct 7-14)
- 5-10 trusted colleagues
- People who understand "alpha"
- Quality feedback over quantity

### Phase 2: Iterate (Oct 14-31)
- Fix what breaks
- Document confusion points
- Build missing features

### Phase 3: Gradual Growth (Nov+)
- Let quality speak
- Organic adoption
- Community when ready

## Why This Matters
We found critical bugs (session state) only through real testing. Your first 5 users will find more than 500 tests.

## The Real Measure
Not download count, but:
- Do YOU use it daily?
- Do those 5 friends keep using it?
- Does it truly help creators achieve their vision?

## Decision Point
October 7: Launch quietly to friends
October 21: Decide on wider promotion based on feedback

Good tools spread naturally. Focus on making 5 people happy before 5000.
