# Next Actions for AGET Framework
*Created: 2025-09-25 during strategic vision expansion*

## Immediate Context
We've discovered AGET is much more than "CLI agent templates" - it's a cognitive augmentation framework for any software or data work. Strategic governance belongs in AGET-AGET, not here.

## Tomorrow's Session Actions

### 1. Framework Identity
- [ ] Consider keeping or refining name:
  - `aget-cli-agent-template` - Current, accurate for v2
  - `aget-cli-agent-framework` - If emphasizing beyond templates
  - `aget-cli-agent-toolkit` - If emphasizing tool collection
  - Name is negotiable, but "CLI agent" part remains accurate
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect cognitive spectrum vision
- [ ] Clarify: CLI agent is the INTERFACE, cognitive augmentation is the FUNCTION

### 2. Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Ensure all tests still passing after today's changes
- [ ] Verify CI is green with compatibility fixes
- [ ] Check coverage is at 80%
- [ ] Prepare for v2.0.0-beta tag

### 3. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README with expanded vision (but keep details in AGET-AGET)
- [ ] Ensure templates reflect all five modalities
- [ ] Add examples for non-code use cases

## Key Realization
**This repository is the WHAT (implementation), AGET-AGET is the WHY (governance)**

## Conversation Context Rule
When in this repository, conversations should be about:
- Bug fixes and implementation
- Pattern improvements
- Technical details
- User-facing features

Strategic vision conversations should happen in AGET-AGET.

## Dependencies
- Awaiting strategic decisions from AGET-AGET
- Should pull governance updates regularly
- Implements what AGET-AGET decides
