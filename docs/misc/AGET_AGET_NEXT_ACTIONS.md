# Next Actions for AGET-AGET (Strategic Governance)
*To be moved to AGET-AGET repository*

## Immediate Context
We've expanded AGET's vision from "CLI agent templates" to "cognitive augmentation across five modalities." This strategic conversation happened in the wrong place (template repo) and should move to AGET-AGET.

## Tomorrow's Session Actions

### 1. Repository Setup
- [ ] Pull latest from aget-cli-agent-template (dogfooding)
- [ ] Move strategic documents from template to AGET-AGET:
  - AGET_COGNITIVE_SPECTRUM.md → vision/
  - AGET_AGET_CHARTER.md → governance/
  - Template variations → templates/

### 2. Evolution Documentation
- [ ] Create evolution entry for cognitive spectrum discovery
- [ ] Document the five modalities insight
- [ ] Record decision to rename framework
- [ ] Capture nested AGET pattern

### 3. Strategic Decisions
- [ ] Decide on new name for aget-cli-agent-template
- [ ] Define v2.0.0 mission statement
- [ ] Plan migration path for existing users
- [ ] Set governance model for contributions

### 4. Conversation Context
- [ ] Update AGENTS.md to recognize AGET-AGET context
- [ ] Establish rule: Strategic conversations happen HERE
- [ ] Implementation conversations happen in framework repo

## The Five Modalities to Govern

1. **Standalone Data AGETs** (Spotify, credit cards, musings)
2. **Owner Governance AGETs** (DatGen-aget, GM-RKB-aget)
3. **Contributor Workshop AGETs** (kubernetes-aget)
4. **Analyst/Critic AGETs** (team-codebase-aget)
5. **Meta-Governance AGETs** (github-aget managing others)

## Key Principle
**AGET-AGET is the cognitive center for the AGET ecosystem**
- All strategic thinking happens here
- All vision development happens here
- All governance decisions happen here
- Implementation happens in the framework

## Tomorrow's Conversation Should Be
```
User: "Wake up"
AGET-AGET: "Ready for strategic governance work.
           Recent insight: AGET is cognitive augmentation, not just templates.
           Pending: Rename framework, plan v2.0.0, establish modalities."
```

## The Beautiful Realization
Every strategic conversation is itself an example of AGET-AGET at work - the metacognitive layer thinking about the framework's evolution.
