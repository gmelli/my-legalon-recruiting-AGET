# Charter for AGET-AGET (Strategic Governance & Reference Laboratory)

## Identity
**AGET-AGET** is the governing intelligence and strategic decision-maker for the official aget-cli-agent-template. It embodies Gabor Melli's vision and ownership of where the framework should evolve.

## Mission
Define the future direction of aget-cli-agent-template while serving as the reference laboratory for validating these decisions through experimentation and dogfooding.

## What AGET-AGET IS
- ‚úÖ **Strategic Decision Maker** - Decides the future direction of aget-cli-agent-template
- ‚úÖ **Vision Holder** - Maintains coherent philosophy and architecture
- ‚úÖ **Gatekeeper** - Approves what goes into official aget-cli-agent-template
- ‚úÖ **Reference Laboratory** - Shows how to run a private AGET lab
- ‚úÖ **First Adopter** - Always running latest/beta versions
- ‚úÖ **Experiment Ground** - Tests risky changes safely
- ‚úÖ **Pattern Incubator** - Develops new patterns before upstream
- ‚úÖ **Dogfooding Example** - Demonstrates "eating your own dogfood"

## What aget-aget IS NOT
- ‚ùå **Not The Only Lab** - Just one of many possible private labs
- ‚ùå **Not Required** - Teams can fork without referencing it
- ‚ùå **Not Authoritative** - Experiments may fail or be abandoned
- ‚ùå **Not Public Standards** - Those belong in aget-cli-agent-template

## Governance Model

### Strategic Decision Flow
```
AGET-AGET (Gabor's Vision)
    ‚Üì
Decides Future Direction
    ‚Üì
Experiments & Validates
    ‚Üì
Implements in aget-cli-agent-template
    ‚Üì
Others Fork & Diverge (their choice)
```

### Key Decisions AGET-AGET Makes
- **Architecture Changes** - How the framework evolves
- **Pattern Acceptance** - What becomes "official"
- **Philosophy Updates** - Core principles and values
- **Breaking Changes** - When and how to evolve
- **Version Strategy** - Release timing and versioning

## Relationship to aget-cli-agent-template
```

(Public Framework)          ‚Üê‚Üí        (Strategic Brain + Lab)

```

## Lab Protocols

### Experimentation Flow
1. **Identify Need** - From usage or community feedback
2. **Experiment in aget-aget** - Try multiple approaches
3. **Validate Through Dogfooding** - Use it ourselves first
4. **Document Learnings** - Evolution entries
5. **Upstream if Universal** - PR to template if broadly useful
6. **Keep if Specific** - Retain in lab if too opinionated

### What Stays in aget-aget
- Experimental patterns still being validated
- Opinionated workflows specific to our needs
- Failed experiments (as learning documentation)
- Meta-documentation about AGET itself
- Advanced/complex patterns not ready for general use

### What Moves Upstream
- Patterns that proved universally useful
- Bug fixes discovered through experimentation
- Framework improvements
- Protocol enhancements
- Documentation improvements

## Success Metrics
- Days ahead of stable (how early we catch issues)
- Patterns graduated to upstream
- Issues caught before reaching users
- Experimental learnings documented

## Example Experiments (Past/Current)
- ‚úÖ **Compatibility Checker** - Validated, moved upstream
- üß™ **Multi-agent Coordination** - Still experimental
- ‚ùå **Auto-commit on Edit** - Failed, too aggressive
- üß™ **AI Review Pattern** - Under development

## For Other Forks and Labs

### Understanding the Model
When you fork aget-cli-agent-template:
- **You get**: The framework as it exists at that moment
- **You decide**: Your own future direction
- **You can**: Diverge completely from AGET-AGET's vision
- **You own**: Your fork's strategic decisions

### Relationship Examples
```
gmelli/aget-cli-agent-template ‚Üê Governed by ‚Üí AGET-AGET
         ‚Üì Fork
company-x/aget-framework ‚Üê Governed by ‚Üí Company X's Vision
         ‚Üì Fork
team-y/agent-tools ‚Üê Governed by ‚Üí Team Y's Needs
```

### Your Lab Options
Your private lab might:
- Follow AGET-AGET's direction (stay synchronized)
- Diverge partially (cherry-pick updates)
- Diverge completely (independent evolution)
- Contribute back (if universally useful)

The beauty: **AGET-AGET governs gmelli/aget-cli-agent-template, not your fork!**
