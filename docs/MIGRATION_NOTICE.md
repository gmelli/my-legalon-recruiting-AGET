# Document Migration Notice

## Strategic Documents Have Moved

The following strategic governance documents have been migrated to their proper home in [aget-aget](https://github.com/gmelli/aget-aget):

### Migrated Documents
- **AGET_COGNITIVE_SPECTRUM.md** → [aget-aget/vision/COGNITIVE_SPECTRUM.md](https://github.com/gmelli/aget-aget/blob/main/vision/COGNITIVE_SPECTRUM.md)
- **AGET_AGET_CHARTER.md** → [aget-aget/governance/CHARTER.md](https://github.com/gmelli/aget-aget/blob/main/governance/CHARTER.md)
- **AGET_AGET_NEXT_ACTIONS.md** → [aget-aget/governance/NEXT_ACTIONS.md](https://github.com/gmelli/aget-aget/blob/main/governance/NEXT_ACTIONS.md)

## Why This Migration?

### Clear Separation of Concerns
- **aget-aget**: Strategic vision, governance, experiments
- **aget-cli-agent-template**: Stable implementation, public patterns

### Benefits
1. Public framework remains stable for forks
2. Strategic vision can evolve without breaking implementations
3. Clear governance authority established
4. Experiments happen safely in private
