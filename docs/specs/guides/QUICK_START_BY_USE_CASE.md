# Quick Start by Use Case

## "I inherited a codebase I don't understand"

**Your Goal**: Document what exists so you can maintain it

1. Start with empty templates - they're your notebook
2. Run the code (if possible) and document what happens
3. Use discovery patterns: `aget apply analysis/discover_endpoints`
4. Fill templates gradually as understanding grows
5. After 30 days, you'll have living documentation

**Key Templates**:
- FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS: "What does this actually do?"
- BUSINESS_RULES: "Why does it work this way?"

## "I have a dataset I want to explore"

**Your Goal**: Create a persistent AI conversation partner for your data

1. Start with DATA_SPECIFICATIONS template
2. Document your data schema and sources
3. Capture interesting queries as "requirements"
4. Record insights as "business rules"
5. Build a knowledge base about your data

**Key Templates**:
- DATA_SPECIFICATIONS: Schema, formats, sources
- FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS: "What questions can I answer?"
- BUSINESS_RULES: "What patterns have I found?"

**Example**: spotify-aget tracks listening patterns over years

## "I'm building something new with AI assistance"

**Your Goal**: Help AI understand your vision

1. Start with requirements BEFORE coding
2. Define what success looks like
3. Document decisions as business rules
4. Let AI use specs to guide implementation
5. Specs evolve alongside code

**Key Templates**:
- FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS: "What I want to build"
- BUSINESS_RULES: "Constraints and decisions"
- DATA_SPECIFICATIONS: "Information architecture"

---

## "I have scripts/tools I want to organize"

**Your Goal**: Create unified interface for disparate tools

1. Inventory what you have in requirements
2. Document each tool's purpose
3. Define common patterns as business rules
4. Create consistent interface
5. AGET becomes your tool orchestrator

**Key Templates**:
- FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS: "What each tool does"
- BUSINESS_RULES: "When to use which tool"
- API_SPECIFICATIONS: "Common interface"

---

## "I'm learning a new technology/codebase"

**Your Goal**: Track your understanding as it grows

1. Templates become your learning journal
2. Document what you understand (even if wrong)
3. Update as understanding improves
4. Questions are valid documentation
5. Progress is visible over time

**Key Templates**:
- FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS: "What I think this does"
- BUSINESS_RULES: "Patterns I'm noticing"
- Notes sections: "Questions I have"

---

## "I'm teaching others"

**Your Goal**: Create structured learning path

1. Requirements become learning objectives
2. Business rules become key concepts
3. Data specs become exercises
4. Templates guide student discovery
5. Progress tracking built in

**Key Templates**:
- FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS: "What students will learn"
- BUSINESS_RULES: "Concepts to understand"
- DATA_SPECIFICATIONS: "Exercises and examples"

## Universal Principles

Regardless of your use case:

1. **Start empty** - Templates are your canvas
2. **Document questions** - Not knowing is valid
3. **Iterate frequently** - Understanding grows
4. **AI reads your specs** - Better specs = better help
5. **Specs are conversation** - Between you, your code, and AI

## The Power of Progressive Specification

```
Day 1:   "I don't know" → Empty templates with questions
Day 7:   "I'm learning" → Partial documentation
Day 30:  "I understand" → Comprehensive specs
Day 90:  "I own this" → Complete knowledge base
```

Your templates evolve with your relationship to the code.
