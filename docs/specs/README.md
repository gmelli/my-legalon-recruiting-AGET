# Specifications Directory

## Choose Your Path

### 🚀 "I'm creating new software"
→ **Most common use case** - AI makes quality software affordable
- Start with requirements and let AI implement
- Define what you want before how to build it
- Specs become the contract with your AI collaborator
- See [`guides/SPEC_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT.md`](guides/SPEC_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT.md)

### 🔄 "I'm modernizing/rebuilding existing software"
→ Document current state, design future state
- Capture existing behavior in specs
- Plan improvements and new features
- AI helps migrate from old to new
- Bridge between legacy and modern

### 🔍 "I inherited unknown code"
→ Reverse-engineer specifications from code
- Start with [`guides/DISCOVERING_YOUR_SPECS.md`](guides/DISCOVERING_YOUR_SPECS.md)
- Document as you explore
- Build understanding progressively

### 📊 "I'm working with data/analytics"
→ Create a persistent data conversation partner
- Start with [`templates/DATA_SPECIFICATIONS_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/DATA_SPECIFICATIONS_TEMPLATE.md)
- Document schemas, queries, insights
- Build analytical memory over time

### 🛠️ "I'm organizing tools/scripts"
→ Create unified interface for disparate tools
- Document what each tool does
- Define common patterns
- Build orchestration layer

### 🎓 "I'm learning/teaching"
→ Track knowledge as it grows
- Document understanding (even if incomplete)
- Track learning objectives
- Create structured learning paths

## Templates for All Use Cases

### 📝 Templates (Start Empty, Fill As You Learn)
- [`templates/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md) - What your system does
- [`templates/BUSINESS_RULES_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/BUSINESS_RULES_TEMPLATE.md) - Why it behaves that way
- [`templates/DATA_SPECIFICATIONS_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/DATA_SPECIFICATIONS_TEMPLATE.md) - How data flows

### 📚 Guides
- [`guides/DISCOVERING_YOUR_SPECS.md`](guides/DISCOVERING_YOUR_SPECS.md) - How to reverse-engineer specifications

### 💡 Examples
Coming soon: Small examples for different project types

## For AGET Framework Development

The AGET framework's complete specifications have been moved to the private `aget-aget` repository for reference implementation.

## Philosophy

**Your specifications should grow with your understanding:**

```
Day 1:   Empty templates → "I don't know what this does yet"
Day 7:   Partial specs → "I'm starting to understand"
Day 30:  Fuller specs → "I know how this works"
Day 90:  Complete specs → "I could rebuild this"
```

## Quick Start

1. Copy templates to your project root
2. Read the discovery guide
3. Start filling in what you know
4. Use AGET patterns to help discover more
5. Update specs as you learn

Remember: **Empty specs are better than no specs.** Start documenting what you know, even if it's just questions!
