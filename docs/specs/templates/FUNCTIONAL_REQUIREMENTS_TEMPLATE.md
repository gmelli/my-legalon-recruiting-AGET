# [PROJECT NAME] Functional Requirements

> What happens here - document as you discover, design, or teach

## Getting Started

**Choose your perspective:**
- 🔍 **Discovering**: "I'm finding out what this does"
- 🚀 **Designing**: "I'm planning what this will do"
- 📊 **Analyzing**: "I'm documenting what I can do with this data"
- 🎓 **Learning**: "I'm understanding what this teaches me"

<!-- Start by listing the 3-5 most important things -->

### FR-001: [Primary Purpose]
**Description**: <!-- What is the main thing your system does? -->
**User Story**: As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] <!-- How do you know it worked? -->
- [ ] <!-- What must be true when complete? -->

### FR-002: [Core Feature]
**Description**: <!-- What's another essential feature? -->
**User Story**: <!-- Who uses this and why? -->
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] <!-- Measurable success criteria -->

### FR-003: [Key Capability]
<!-- Copy this pattern for each major function you discover -->

## Feature Categories
<!-- As you discover more requirements, organize them into categories -->

### User Management
<!-- If your system has users -->

### Data Processing
<!-- If your system handles data -->

### Integration Points
<!-- If your system connects to others -->

### Reporting/Output
<!-- What your system produces -->

## Discovery Questions
Use these prompts to find your requirements:

1. **Who uses this system?** (Users/Actors)

4. **What outputs are produced?** (Deliverables)
   - <!-- Files, reports, data, UI changes -->

5. **What can go wrong?** (Error cases)
   - <!-- How should errors be handled? -->

### Nice to Have (Desired)
- <!-- Would improve experience -->

### Won't Have (Out of scope)
- <!-- Explicitly not doing -->
