# Governance & Strategic Vision

## Important Notice
Strategic governance and vision documents have moved to their proper home:

**→ [aget-aget](https://github.com/gmelli/aget-aget)**

## What Lives Where

### In AGET-AGET (Strategic Governance)
The private governance repository maintains:
- **Vision Documents** - Cognitive spectrum, future possibilities
- **Governance Charter** - Strategic decision-making authority
- **Strategic Roadmap** - Future direction and planning
- **Experiments** - Unproven patterns and radical ideas
- **Case Studies** - Real-world AGET implementations

### In This Repository (Public Framework)
The public template provides:
- **Implementation** - Stable, tested framework code
- **Public Patterns** - Validated, universal patterns
- **Usage Documentation** - How-to guides and tutorials
- **Templates** - Starter configurations

## Why This Separation?

1. **Stability** - Public framework remains stable for forks
2. **Innovation** - Experiments happen safely in private
3. **Governance** - Clear authority and decision flow
4. **Evolution** - Strategic vision can evolve without breaking implementations

## For Contributors

- **Framework improvements** → Submit PRs here
- **Pattern contributions** → Submit PRs here (if universal)
- **Strategic suggestions** → Open issues in aget-aget
- **Experimental features** → Develop in your own AGET lab

## Decision Flow
```
aget-aget (Vision) → aget-cli-agent-template (Implementation) → Your Fork (Customization)
```
