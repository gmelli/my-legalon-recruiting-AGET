# Next Steps - Session #55 Wind Down

**Date**: 2025-09-24 Evening
**Status**: v2 vision unified, ready for implementation

## Completed Today
- ✅ Unified v2 Charter (CLI) with Framework vision
- ✅ Created AGET_VOCABULARY.md
- ✅ Updated ROADMAP_v2.md
- ✅ Documented framework vision
- ✅ Tested `aget init` (works but needs enhancements)

## Discovered Issues
1. `aget init` doesn't create `outputs/` or `data/` directories
2. Missing `.aget/evolution/` directory for capturing insights
3. Pattern library needs bridge patterns added

## Tomorrow's Priority Tasks
1. **Complete CLI Gate 2** (Pattern Library - 35 hours allocated)
   - Start with session + housekeeping patterns
   - ADD bridge patterns for outputs→Outputs

2. **Enhance aget init** to create:
   - `data/` directory
   - `outputs/` directory
   - `.aget/evolution/` directory
   - Proper vocabulary reference

3. **Begin llm-manager-aget**
   - Use enhanced `aget init`
   - Apply standard template
   - Start OpenAI tracking

## Key Insight to Remember
CLI and Framework aren't competing visions - they're complementary:
- CLI makes agents easy to create
- Agents prove framework value
- Together they deliver the promise
