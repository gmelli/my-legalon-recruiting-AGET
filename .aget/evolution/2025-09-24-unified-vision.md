# Evolution Entry: Unified Vision Breakthrough

**Date**: 2025-09-24
**Session**: 4+ hours with extensive exploration

## Key Breakthroughs

1. **Naming Convention Crystallized**
   - `aget-*` for framework
   - `*-aget` for agents
   - This wasn't in original plan!

2. **outputs vs Outputs**
   - Critical vocabulary distinction discovered
   - Changes entire mental model

3. **Privateâ†’Public Bridge**
   - Agents don't just automate
   - They create public value from private work
   - Multi-output reality

## Integration Insight

Original v2 Charter (CLI tool) and new Framework vision are NOT competing - they're complementary:
- CLI creates agents easily
- Agents prove framework works
- Together they deliver the vision

## Next Steps
- Use CLI to create llm-manager-aget
- Prove bridge mechanism
- Extract first Output

## Session Cost
- Conceptual value: Immeasurable
- Unified two visions into one
