# Session Protocol Script Fix Report

## Issue Description
**Date Found**: September 25, 2025 (Day 2 Testing)
**Severity**: Critical
**Impact**: Scripts failed with KeyError when session state files were missing or corrupted

## Root Cause
The session protocol scripts (`aget_session_protocol.py` and `session_protocol.py`) failed when:
1. Existing `.session_state.json` files lacked required keys
2. Files were corrupted or partially written
3. Migration from older versions left incomplete state

Error: `KeyError: 'session_count'` at line 67 in `start_session()`

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced the `load()` method in SessionState class to:
1. Load existing state files
2. Check for missing required keys
3. Add default values for any missing keys
4. Handle nested structures (current_session)

### Code Change
```python
def load(self):
    """Load session state from disk"""
    if self.state_file.exists():
        try:
            with open(self.state_file, 'r') as f:
                loaded_state = json.load(f)
                # Ensure all required keys exist
                default = self.default_state()
                for key in default:
                    if key not in loaded_state:
                        loaded_state[key] = default[key]
                # Ensure current_session has all required keys
                if 'current_session' in loaded_state:
                    for key in default['current_session']:
                        if key not in loaded_state['current_session']:
                            loaded_state['current_session'][key] = default['current_session'][key]
                return loaded_state
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, IOError):
            return self.default_state()
    return self.default_state()
```

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Normal Operation
✅ Wake protocol works correctly
✅ Wind-down protocol saves state
✅ Session counting works

### Test 2: Corrupted State File
✅ Handles `{"incomplete": true}` gracefully
✅ Adds missing keys automatically
✅ No errors thrown

### Test 3: Fresh Installation
✅ Creates new state file correctly
✅ Works with no existing state
✅ Initializes all required keys

### Test 4: Migration Scenario
✅ Upgrades old state files
✅ Preserves existing data
✅ Adds new required fields

## Files Modified
1. `/scripts/aget_session_protocol.py` - Fixed load() method
2. `/scripts/session_protocol.py` - Already had fix applied

## Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Preserves existing session counts
- ✅ Maintains session history
- ✅ No data loss during upgrade

## Recommendations
1. **For Existing Projects**: Copy updated scripts during migration
2. **For New Installs**: Scripts now work out-of-box
3. **For v2.0 Release**: Include this fix in all templates

## Impact on Day 2 Results
- **Before Fix**: Scripts 0/2 working (0%)
- **After Fix**: Scripts 2/2 working (100%)
- **Overall Success**: Now 100% (was 75%)

## Lessons Learned
1. Session state initialization must be defensive
2. Always provide defaults for missing keys
3. Handle partial/corrupted files gracefully
4. Test with various state file conditions
