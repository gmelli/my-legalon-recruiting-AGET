# AGET Use Cases and Specification Strategy

## Core Insight
AGET serves different purposes for different types of projects. The specification documents in the public repo should be **templates and guides** for users to fill in, while aget-aget serves as a **reference implementation** showing rich, complete specifications.

## Primary Use Cases

### 1. Code Analysis & Reverse Engineering
**Scenario**: User inherits unknown codebase, needs to understand it
**AGET Role**: Progressive specification discovery
**Process**:
1. Initial exploration: "What does this do?"
2. Document discoveries in specs/
3. Build understanding over time
4. Eventually manage/maintain the codebase

**Specification Evolution**:
```
Day 1: Empty templates
Day 7: Basic functional requirements discovered
Day 30: Business rules understood
Day 90: Full specifications documented
```

### 2. Data Analysis Agent
**Scenario**: User has dataset (e.g., Spotify listening history)
**AGET Role**: Persistent conversation context for data exploration
**Example**: spotify-aget
**Process**:
1. Initial data exploration
2. Document data schema in specs/
3. Capture analysis patterns
4. Build reusable analysis tools
5. Maintain as long-term data companion

**Specifications Focus**:
- Data schemas
- Query patterns
- Visualization rules
- Privacy boundaries

### 3. New Project Development
**Scenario**: Starting fresh project with AI assistance
**AGET Role**: Specification-first development
**Process**:
1. Define requirements upfront
2. AI uses specs to guide implementation
3. Specs evolve with project
4. Maintain alignment between spec and code

### 4. Tool/Utility Management
**Scenario**: Collection of scripts/tools that need organization
**AGET Role**: Unified interface for disparate tools
**Process**:
1. Inventory existing tools
2. Document each tool's purpose
3. Create consistent interface
4. Manage as tool suite

### 5. Learning/Tutorial Repository
**Scenario**: Educational codebase for teaching concepts
**AGET Role**: Progressive learning guide
**Process**:
1. Document learning objectives
2. Capture prerequisites
3. Define exercises
4. Track student progress

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Templates in Public Repo
1. Create empty/template specs with helpful prompts
2. Include "fill in the blank" sections
3. Provide minimal examples (not overwhelming)
4. Focus on guiding users to discover their own specs

### Phase 2: Patterns for Specification Discovery
```python
patterns/analysis/
├── discover_functions.py    # Find all functions, guess purpose
├── extract_data_schema.py   # Analyze data structures
├── identify_patterns.py     # Find repeated code patterns
├── document_rules.py        # Extract business logic
└── generate_specs.py        # Create draft specifications
```

### Phase 3: Reference Implementation in aget-aget
1. Fully document aget-aget's own specs
2. Show how specs evolve over time
3. Demonstrate different spec styles for different projects
4. Maintain as living example

## Key Principles

### 1. Progressive Specification
- Start with empty templates
- Build understanding over time
- Specs are living documents
- Discovery is iterative

### 2. Project-Appropriate Specs
- Code libraries need API specs
- Data projects need schema specs
- Tool collections need inventory specs
- Educational repos need learning specs

### 3. Templates vs Examples
- **Templates**: Empty structures with prompts
- **Examples**: Small, focused illustrations
- **Reference**: aget-aget as complete implementation

### 4. Specification as Conversation
- Specs are how users talk to AI about their project
- AI uses specs to understand user intent
- Specs bridge human understanding and code reality

## Benefits of This Approach

### For Users
- Not overwhelmed by complex examples
- Guided discovery process
- Specs appropriate to their project type
- Can see reference implementation if needed

### For AGET Development
- Clear separation: templates (public) vs implementation (private)
- aget-aget becomes valuable reference
- Supports multiple use cases elegantly
- Encourages specification-driven development

### For AI Agents
- Clear context about project purpose
- Understands what's discovered vs unknown
- Can help fill in specification gaps
- Knows how to evolve specs over time

## Next Steps

1. **Simplify current specs** in aget-cli-agent-template
   - Convert to templates with prompts
   - Add "How to fill this in" guidance
   - Remove overwhelming detail

2. **Create discovery patterns**
   - Tools to help users find their specs
   - Automated analysis helpers
   - Specification generators

3. **Enrich aget-aget specs**
   - Fully document our meta-framework
   - Show evolution over time
   - Demonstrate multiple project types

4. **Document the journey**
   - How specs evolve from empty to complete
   - Case studies of specification discovery
   - Patterns across different project types

This approach makes AGET truly useful for its core mission: helping users understand and manage any codebase, whether inherited, created, or discovered.
