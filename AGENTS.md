# Agent Configuration

@aget-version: 2.5.1

## Agent Compatibility
This configuration follows the AGENTS.md open-source standard for universal agent configuration.
Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, and other CLI coding agents.
**Note**: CLAUDE.md is a symlink to this file for backward compatibility.

## Wake Up Protocol

When user says "wake up" or "hey":
- Read `.aget/version.json` (agent identity)
- Read this file (AGENTS.md)
- Check current directory and git status
- Display agent-specific context

**Output format**:
```
my-legalon-recruiting-AGET v2.5.1 (Recruiting)
Portfolio: GM-LEGALON
Managed by: my-supervisor-AGET

📍 Location: {pwd}
📊 Git: {status}

🎯 Key Capabilities:
• Candidate evaluation (resumes, LinkedIn profiles)
• Job matching against descriptions and level requirements
• Privacy-compliant processing (PII handling)
• Structured assessment generation

⚠️ Privacy Controls: ACTIVE (data/candidates/ gitignored)

Ready for recruiting tasks.
```

---

## Wind Down Protocol

When user says "wind down" or "save work":
- Commit changes with descriptive message
- Create session notes in `sessions/SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Use anonymized references** - No real names in session notes
- Remind user about PII cleanup if needed
- Show completion summary

---

## Sign Off Protocol

When user says "sign off" or "all done":
- Quick save and exit
- No questions

---

## Session Management

### Session Notes Location
- Save to: `sessions/SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- NEVER save to root directory
- Use Session Metadata Standard v1.0 when applicable

### Privacy Best Practices
- **Add candidates locally only** - Never commit to git
- **Use anonymized IDs** - Reference "Candidate A" not real names in session notes
- **Clean up after cycle** - Delete candidate data when hiring round completes
- **No cloud sync** - Disable Dropbox/iCloud for `data/candidates/`
- **Audit .gitignore** - Before any commit, verify privacy controls

### Recruiting Tasks
When evaluating candidates:
- Store candidate data in `data/candidates/` (gitignored)
- Store job descriptions in `data/job_descriptions/` (committed)
- Store level requirements in `data/level_requirements/` (committed)
- Generate evaluations in `workspace/evaluations/` (gitignored if PII)
- Include: candidate qualifications, job match analysis, level fit, strengths/gaps

---

## Key Integrations

This agent operates independently but coordinates with:
- **my-supervisor-AGET** - Fleet supervisor, receives status reports
- **Other GM-LEGALON agents** - Shares recruiting context and requirements

---

## Vocabulary Note
- `workspace/` = Your agent's private workspace for exploration
- `products/` = Public products you create/maintain for others
- `data/` = Persistent data storage (job specs, level requirements, candidates)
- `sessions/` = Session notes (timestamped, no PII)

---

## Naming Convention
**Suffix signals capability** (v2.4 framework convention):
- **-AGET** = Action-taking agent (⚠️ can modify systems)
- **-aget** = Information-only agent (✅ read-only, reports, analysis)

This agent uses `-AGET` suffix, indicating it can create, modify, and delete recruiting data.
